summary: Could async/await be slowing down your code? Yeah, you read it right! With a little oversight, you may be inadvertently serializing parts of code which can otherwise run concurrently.

async/await comes to JavaScript as a breath of fresh air, but it is easy to use it wrong. You may be serializing independent function calls that could run concurrently.


Consider this code:

```js
  async function getAllUsers(idArr) {
    const users = [];
    for(let i=0; i<idArr.lengh; i++)
      users.push(await find(idArr[i])); // find returns a Promise
    return users;
  }
```

At first, nothing may seem out of place. On closer inspection, one will realise that the 'find' calls are serialized. Each call waits for the previous to complete.


How would promises work?

```js
  function getAllUsers(idArr) {
    const pArr = idArr.map(id => find(id));
    return Promise.all(users);
  }
```

The right way using async/await would be:

```js
  async function getAllUsers(idArr) {
    const pArr = idArr.map(id => find(id));
    return await Promise.all(users);
  }
```

Looking at another example:

```js
  function echoAfter(msg, seconds) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(msg);
      }, seconds);
    });
  }
  async function foo() {
    const p1 = echoAfter("first", 10);
    const p2 = echoAfter("second", 20);
    const p3 = echoAfter("third", 30);

    return await p1 + await p2 + await p3;
  }
```

The function foo returns in 30 seconds. All three calls run concurrently because they were kicked off and running before being awaited.

Now, foo is changed to look like this (line-breaks are for readability):

```js
  async function foo() {
    return await echoAfter("first", 10) +
      await echoAfter("second", 20) +
      await echoAfter("third", 30);
  }
```

The calls are no longer concurrent and foo returns after 50 seconds!

If this confuses you, you might find awaiting Promise.all to be the safest:

```js
  async function foo() {
    const p1 = echoAfter("first", 10);
    const p2 = echoAfter("second", 20);
    const p3 = echoAfter("third", 30);

    const results = await Promise.all([ p1, p2, p3 ]);
    return results.reduce((a, b) => a + b, "");
  }
```
