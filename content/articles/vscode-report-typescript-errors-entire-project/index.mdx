VSCode reports TypeScript errors only from the currently open files. In my opinion, this nearly defeats the purpose of using types in a large codebase. If I were to make a type change in one of my files, which breaks a different module, I want my IDE to flag the error. Intellisense and compile-time error-reporting is a bare minimum requirement of any IDE.

Why VSCode doesn't have this ability out of the box is truly baffling. A quick search reveals an [open issue on the VSCode repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/13953) which hasn't been resolved in over three years! There are some decent workarounds suggested in that thread. I managed to distill that information into a quick recipe.


## Create a TypeScript Watch Task

Create a file called `.vscode/tasks.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "tsc watch",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "./node_modules/.bin/tsc",
      "isBackground": true,
      "args": ["--watch", "--noEmit", "--project", "path/to/tsconfig"],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "never",
        "echo": false,
        "focus": false,
        "panel": "dedicated"
      },
      "problemMatcher": "$tsc-watch",
      "runOptions": {
        "runOn": "folderOpen"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

__Note about `type`:__ For a custom task, `type` can either be `shell` or `process` If `shell` is specified, the command is interpreted as a shell command (for example: `bash`, `cmd`, or PowerShell). If `process` is specified, the command is interpreted as a process to execute.


### Auto-Starting the Task

First, automatic tasks must be enabled in VSCode:

1. `Ctrl + Shift + P`
1. Select "Tasks: Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder"
1. Choose "Allow Automatic Tasks in Folder"
1. Close and re-open the workspace

Our `tsc` watch task is set to start automatically when the folder is opened:

```json
"runOn" : "folderOpen"
```

__Ref:__ https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_30#_run-on-folder-open


### Integrating With VSCode's UI

The `problemMatcher` config is used to hook into the output of `tsc`:

```json
"problemMatcher": "$tsc-watch"
```

TypeScript errors from anywhere within the workspace will now be reported in the Problems panel!

Also, the Explorer panel shows the number of errors next to the file name. Files and folders are colored in red if errors are detected.

## Does Your Project Have Multiple Root Folders?

Mine does. For a multi-root workspace create another file `.vscode/tscwatch.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
./root1/node_modules/.bin/tsc --watch --noEmit --project root1 &
P1=$!
./root2/node_modules/.bin/tsc --watch --noEmit --project root2 &
P2=$!
wait $P1 $P2
```

`$!` is the PID of the last launched process. Waiting on both PIDs ensures that when the process is killed, both PIDs are killed too.

Next, change `.vscode/tasks.config`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "TS Watch",
      "type": "process",
      "command": "./.vscode/tscwatch.sh",
      "isBackground": true,
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "never",
        "echo": false,
        "focus": false,
        "panel": "shared"
      },
      "problemMatcher": "$tsc-watch",
      "runOptions": {
        "runOn": "folderOpen"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the change in task `type`.

Restart VSCode to start off multiple watcher tasks in parallel.

## Too Many Files to Watch?
If there are far too many files in the workspace (tends to happen in a multi-root workspace), your OS could run out of watchers. You'd know when you see an error like this:

```sh
ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached
```

You can retrieve the current limit for the number of watchers like so:

```sh
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
```

To raise the limit edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` (you'd need root access) and set this the value of `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` to a higher number (max 524288):

```sh
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

__Source:__ https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers


Apply changes:

```sh
sudo sysctl -p
```

With these tweaks, VSCode makes writing TypeScript much easier! I can rely on VSCode to slap me on the wrists every time I make a breaking change without needing to run a TypeScript watch in a terminal. I have found this to be a big productivity boost!
