For over a century, physicists have predicted the presence of massive objects in space, whose gravitation is so strong that they gobble up all matter in the vicinity. Though, there has been compelling evidence of the existence of these so-called *black holes*, we haven't actually seen one.

All we have is 'indirect' evidence of the presence of such objects. Phenomena such as gravitational lensing, and the orbital patters of stars, give us an idea of the location and mass of these massive objects. Here is a video *(this is not a simulation or an animation)* of stars orbiting something invisible, something with immense mass, which fits our understanding of a black hole:

The black hole in the video, christened, [Sagittarius A\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*), is located at the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way.

## The Event Horizon Telescope

The [Event Horizon Telescope](http://eventhorizontelescope.org/) is an international collaboration capturing images of black holes using a virtual Earth-sized telescope. The project was founded with the goal of snapping the picture of the super massive black hole, Sagittarius A\*. It links radio dishes across the globe to create an Earth-sized interferometer. Armed with arrays of powerful telescopes from all across the world, the EHT team expects to have some results within the next five years.
